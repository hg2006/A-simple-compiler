# A SIMPL to A-PRIMPL Compiler, CS 146, W23
This compiler was done as two consecutive assignment question of CS 146, W23 offering, instructed by Brad Lushman, at the University of Waterloo. Relevant assignments are [Q9:Compile SIMPL](https://github.com/hg2006/A-simple-compiler/issues/1#issue-1689627528) and [Q10:Compile SIMPL-F](https://github.com/hg2006/A-simple-compiler/issues/2#issue-1689627569)

## A simple imperative language: SIMPL

### Motivation
SIMPL is an artificial imperative language, designed by the instructor team of CS 146, that only supports a very small subset of features of imperative programming. To avoid complicated parsing issues and only focus on the core concepts of imperative programming, S-expression syntax is used.
The following are the elements of imperative programming based on which SIMPL is developed:
- Statements that produce no useful value, but get things done through side effects.
- Expressions only as part of statements. (Note since in CS 146 we proceeded into imperative programming from functional programming, namely Racket, distinguishing between statements and expressions are important)
- Sequencing of two or more statements
- Conditional evaluation
- Repetition

### Grammar
Below is the grammar of simplest version of SIMPL, written in Haskell. <br> <br>

program	 	=	 	(vars [(id number) ...] stmt ...) <br> <br>
 	 	 	 	 
  stmt = (print aexp)  <br>
 &emsp;&emsp;    | (print string) <br>
 &emsp;&emsp;    | (set id aexp) <br>
 &emsp;&emsp; 	  | (seq stmt ...) <br>
 &emsp;&emsp;     | (iif bexp stmt stmt) <br>
 &emsp;&emsp;     | (skip) <br>
 &emsp;&emsp;	 	  | (while bexp stmt ...) <br> <br>

 aexp	=	(+ aexp aexp) <br>
&emsp;&emsp; 	 	  |	(* aexp aexp) <br>
&emsp;&emsp; 	 	  |	(- aexp aexp) <br>
&emsp;&emsp; 	 	  |	(div aexp aexp) <br>
&emsp;&emsp; 	 	  |	(mod aexp aexp) <br>
&emsp;&emsp; 	 	  |	number <br>
&emsp;&emsp; 	 	  |	id <br> <br>
 	 	 	 	 
 bexp = (= aexp aexp) <br>
&emsp;&emsp; 	 	  | (> aexp aexp) <br>
&emsp;&emsp;	 	  |	(< aexp aexp) <br>
&emsp;&emsp; 	    |	(>= aexp aexp) <br>
&emsp;&emsp; 	    |	(<= aexp aexp) <br>
&emsp;&emsp; 	 	  |	(not bexp) <br>
&emsp;&emsp; 	 	  |	(and bexp ...) <br>
&emsp;&emsp; 	 	  |	(or bexp ...) <br>
&emsp;&emsp; 	 	  |	true <br>
&emsp;&emsp; 	 	  |	false <br> <br>
